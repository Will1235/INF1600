<!-- HEADER 9-6-6: Sea-of-Gates Routing -->

<!-- COMMAND Tool/Routing/Sea-Of-Gates Route -->

The sea-of-gates router is able to take an arbitrary set of unrouted arcs and convert them to layout.
<P>
To do this, use the <B>Sea-Of-Gates Route</B> command (in menu <B>Tool / Routing</B>).
If there are unrouted arcs selected, these will be the only ones converted.
Otherwise, all unrouted arcs in the cell will be converted.
<P>
The Sea-of-Gates router uses metal layers in the current technology.
You can disable the use of any layer, or favor it above others to guide the routing.
To do this, use the Routing Preferences
(in menu <B>File / Preferences...</B>, "Tools" section, "Routing" tab).
<P>
Another control found in the Routing Preferences sets the maximum width
of a route segment.
By default, each segment is made as wide as the widest arc already connected to that segment.
However, in some situations, very wide arcs exist, and the connecting routes should not be that wide.
By setting the maximum width, this limits the size of generated layout.
<P>
The other control in the Routing Preferences sets the maximum number of steps that
the router will take to find a route.
The larger the value, the longer the router will run until giving up.
