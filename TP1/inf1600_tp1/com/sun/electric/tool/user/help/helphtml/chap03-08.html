<!-- HEADER 3-8: Rearranging Cell Hierarchy -->

<!-- COMMAND Cell/Package Into Cell... -->
<!-- COMMAND Cell/Extract Cell Instance/One Level Down -->
<!-- COMMAND Cell/Extract Cell Instance/All the Way -->
<!-- COMMAND Cell/Extract Cell Instance/Specified Amount... -->

In order to manipulate hierarchical circuits,
it is useful to create and delete levels of the hierarchy.
The <B>Package Into Cell...</B> command (in menu <B>Cell</B>)
collects everything in the highlighted area into a new cell.
You will be prompted for the cell name.
The most convenient way to specify an area for packaging is to use the Area Selection
commands (see <A HREF="chap02-01-03.html#chap02-01-03">Section 2-1-3</A>).
Every node touching the area is included in the new cell.
All arcs between nodes in the area are also included.
The highlighted circuitry is not affected.
<P>
After packaging circuitry into a new cell, that circuitry can be deleted and replaced with an instance of that cell.
<P>
The opposite function is the removal of levels of hierarchy.
This is done with the <B>Extract Cell Instance</B> subcommands (in menu <B>Cell</B>),
which takes the currently highlighted cell instances and replaces them with their contents.
The <B>One Level Down</B> subcommand just replaces the selected instances with their contents.
The <B>All the Way</B> subcommand continues to extract instances inside of instances until there are
no more instances, just primitives.
The <B>Specified Amount...</B> prompts for a number of levels of hierarchy and extracts that many levels deep.
All arcs that were connected to the cell instances are reconnected to the correct parts of the instantiated circuitry.
